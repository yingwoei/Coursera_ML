Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera

If you come across my github and saw this. Thank you very much for visiting!

This course was my intuitive next step after learning how to process data. Nevertheless, I am keen on getting more hands on experience in managing and processing data before I dive into machine learning. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. I hope to connect with you!
