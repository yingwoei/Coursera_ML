Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng

Assignment 1: I learned about linear regression for one variable and multivariable. I learned how to find parameters, theta using gradient descent to minimize cost function. I also learned how to normalize features before determining theta when the range of variables are too large. I learned to use normal equation to to find parameters analytically.
