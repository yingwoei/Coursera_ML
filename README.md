## Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera

If you come across my github and saw this. Thank you very much for visiting!

This course was my intuitive next step after learning about data processing, data visualization and data analytics. I learned all those in Python and this is in Octave. I believe once I understand the concept of machine learning I can easily transition to a different language since it is just semantics. 

I am keen on getting more hands on experience in the data space. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. I hope to connect with you!
