## What I learned from Assignment 1:

* I learned about linear regression for one variable and multivariable. 
* I learned how to find parameters, theta using gradient descent to minimize cost function. 
* I also learned how to normalize features before determining theta when the range of variables are too large. 
* I learned to use normal equation to to find parameters analytically.
