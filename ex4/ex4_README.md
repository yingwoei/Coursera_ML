## What I learned from Assignment 4
* Implementation of neural networks, particularly vectorized forward propagation to find activation units and cost, and backpropagation to find gradients with and without regularization.
* I also learn about when bias unit should be included/excluded from a calculation. Dimension for matrix multiplication is crucial so it is really important to take the time to understand the dimensionality of each matrix.
