## What I learned from Assignment 6:
* Support Vector Machine (SVM) is useful for non-linearly separable classification.
* SVM is an algorithm that sometimes uses kernel, like Gaussian kernel, to measure the similarity of one training data to other training data in the training set. 
* SVM can be applied in classifying spams, but feature scaling/normalization is required before applying SVM.
