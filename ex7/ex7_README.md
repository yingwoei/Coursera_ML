## What I learned from Assignment 7:
* K-means is an iterative unsupervised algorithm that assigns all training data to the closest centroid, and recalculate the centroid during this process.
* PCA is helpful to reduce dimensions to speed up learning algorithms (such as face recognition) and visualization. It is an orthogonal projection of training data to a line/plane by minimizing the projection error.
* PCA is not linear regression.
